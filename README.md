### Hi, I’m Iris 👋🏻 I'm a fullstack web developer👩‍💻

Trained on a fullstack profile, I work with the JavaScript ecosystem on a variety of projects. With a strong affinity for front-end development, I’m keen to work with the React ecosystem and create dynamic, intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.

I love ramen, cats, and listening to original soundtracks for inspiration. I also love learning new languages : I speak french, english and japanese.

I’m constantly seeking to improve my skills and tackle new challenges, always ready to learn and enhance. Let’s work together !
